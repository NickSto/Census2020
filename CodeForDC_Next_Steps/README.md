# Next Steps and Planning

Next steps and planning for Code for DC's Census event.

* Look up window of time available for people to complete census:
https://2020census.gov/en/important-dates.html
Wed 4/1/20 is Census Day; Note from Kelli: It appears that we should plan to have a createathon before 4/1, but in my email to our Census partners I'll ask what date they need the events to take place before.
* Email census contacts and tell them we met last night (Tues 12/17) and decided to make Jan 20th event a planning session
    * Create-a-thon will be hosted at a later date after we connect with community partners.
* Ask Census for 1) invitation to Creatives For the Count Slack channel, 2) help with connecting with DC's CCC and other community partners, 3) what HTCs would be best for CfDC to focus on/what's still missing in terms of volunteers for partners in DC

# Establish the Basics

* Research and secure your venue. To hold an event, you’ll need a location that includes the following:
    * Tables
    * Seating
    * Power supply
    * Wi-Fi connection
    * Refreshments
    * Projector
    * Work with your event team and community partners to nail down an event space that works for your event style and agenda

* Set a date and time
    * Consider whether it’s feasible for your ideal attendees to attend on a week-day versus weekend, or morning versus evening.
    * Consider offering childcare on site at the event

* Determine your event length and customize your agenda
